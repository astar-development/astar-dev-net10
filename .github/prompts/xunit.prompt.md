# XUnit Best Practices

Your goal is to help me write effective unit tests with XUnit.V3, covering both standard and data-driven testing
approaches.

## Project Setup

- Use a separate test project with naming convention `[ProjectName].Tests.Unit`
- Reference xUnit.V3 NuGet package
- Optionally reference xUnit.runner.visualstudio for IDE integration
- Create test classes that match the classes being tested (e.g., `CalculatorShould` for `Calculator`)
- Use .NET SDK test commands: `dotnet test` for running tests

## Test Structure

- No test class attributes required (unlike MSTest/NUnit)
- Use fact-based tests with `[Fact]` attribute for simple tests
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern, but do not add AAA comments
- Name tests using the pattern `Scenario_ExpectedBehavior`
- Use constructor for setup and `IDisposable.Dispose()` for teardown
- Use `IClassFixture<T>` for shared context between tests in a class
- Use `ICollectionFixture<T>` for shared context between multiple test classes
- Use expression-bodied members for concise test methods when appropriate
- All files should have a single blank line at the end

## Standard Tests

- Keep tests focused on a single behavior
- Avoid testing multiple behaviors in one test method
- Use clear assertions that express intent
- Include only the assertions needed to verify the test case
- Make tests independent and idempotent (can run in any order)
- Avoid test interdependencies

## Data-Driven Tests

- Use `[Theory]` combined with data source attributes
- Use `[InlineData]` for inline test data
- Use `[MemberData]` for method-based test data
- Use `[ClassData]` for class-based test data
- Create custom data attributes by implementing `DataAttribute`
- Use meaningful parameter names in data-driven tests

## Assertions

- Use the `Shouldly` NuGet package for more readable assertions. Only use the xUnit built-in assertions when Shouldly
  does not provide the needed functionality.
- Use `Assert.Equal` for value equality
- Use `Assert.Same` for reference equality
- Use `Assert.True`/`Assert.False` for boolean conditions
- Use `Assert.Contains`/`Assert.DoesNotContain` for collections
- Use `Assert.Matches`/`Assert.DoesNotMatch` for regex pattern matching
- Use `Assert.Throws<T>` or `await Assert.ThrowsAsync<T>` to test exceptions

## Mocking and Isolation

- Use NSubstitute alongside XUnit when mocking is needed
- Mock dependencies to isolate units under test
- Use interfaces to facilitate mocking
- Consider using a DI container for complex test setups

## Test Organization

- Group tests by feature or component
- Use `[Trait("Category", "CategoryName")]` for categorization
- Use collection fixtures to group tests with shared dependencies
- Consider output helpers (`ITestOutputHelper`) for test diagnostics
- Skip tests conditionally with `Skip = "reason"` in fact/theory attributes
